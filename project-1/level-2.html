    <h2>EPHEMERAL INVENTORY</h2>
    <h3>Cyana Madsen</h3>
    <p>
    In the pockets <span class="link">(fig. 1)</span> of that wool blazer with the elbows worn thin you had:
    </p>

    <ul>
    <p>
      1 corner of a green and white card boarding pass for a flight to New York, torn off in haste as you boarded late because you’d lost track of time at the terminal bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      1 book of matches, just two are left in the soft fringe of raw cardboard where you peeled the others off and burnt them to your fingertips trying to read a map on a strange city street at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      1 half of a dry cleaning ticket for trousers, worn to a long forgotten party full of names you had to repeat to yourself silently so you wouldn’t forget.</p>
    <p>
      1 folded paper napkin from a cafe with a phone number that doesn’t exist anymore, creased and coffee stained, with ‘Collect your shirt!’ scribbled in your leaning inky black script.</p>
    <p>
      2 dog eared tickets to the Royal Opera performance of La Traviata, for seats that didn’t have a clear view of the stage.</p>
    <p>
      1 Polaroid photo of you, your eyes were mostly closed but your hair looked perfect, your fingerprint smeared the date written in pen on the back.</p>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I check my own pockets:<br>
      I have my phone.

    <h2>DARK WEBS</h2>
    <h3>Chrisopher Sleboda, Kathleen Sleboda</h3>

    <p>
    The ever-living source of evil on Third Earth in the 1985 animated television series <em>Thundercats</em> is a villain named Mumm-Ra. His powers included sorcery and an unlimited lifespan, and he continually sought to increase his power and spreadhis dark influence <span class="link">(fig. 2)</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The internet is a global system of interconnected computer networksthat rely on the Internet protocol suite—specific communication protocols—to link devices worldwide. Or is it some kind of sorcery? Do Mumm-Ra and the internet have more in common than one might think?
    </p>
    <p>
      Quantum Computer Services was founded the same year that Lion-O, the hero of the Thundercats, used the Sword of Omens (a magical weapon that could fire bolts of energy and give its owner “Sight Beyond Sight,” or the power to see across vast distances). In 1989, Quantum changed its name to America Online (AOL). The company intended to become the service for people unfamiliar with computers. Soon the internet age dawned-and AOL carpet-bombed the masses with 3.5-inch floppy discs and CD-ROMs that proclaimed “Try America Online FREE!”
    </p>
    <p>
    The strategy was successful. When AOL went public in 1992, they had less than 200,000 subscribers <span class="link">(fig. 3)</span>. A decade later their subscriber number had ballooned into the 25 million range. Mumm-Ra would have been pleased with that expansion of power.
    </p>
    <p>
      The original AOL logo referenced the all-seeing eye (also known as the Eye of Providence), housed in a pyramid form. The symbol represents the eye <span class="link">(fig. 4)</span> of God watching over humanity. Mumm-Ra lived in a black pyramid amid the ruins of an ancient Egyptian civilization. But the fortress, where he retired to replenish his power, ultimately becomes a prison in various episodes of the show. In much the same way, the CD-ROMs and floppies that once heralded the power of AOL became the branded detritus of an ambitious internet pioneer. It seems that all universes eventualy confine unchecked power and ambition.

    <h2>WIKIPEDIA: LINK ROT</h2>
    <h3>Wikipedia</h3>

    <p>
      Like most large websites, Wikipedia suffers from the phenomenon known as link rot, where external links become dead, as the linked web pages or complete websites disappear, change their content, or move without HTML redirection. This presents a significant threat to Wikipedia’s reliability policy and its source citation guideline.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, do not delete cited information solely because the URL to the source does not work any longer. Tools, procedures, and processes are available as outlined in this document.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dead, unarchived source URL may still be useful. Such a link indicates that information was (probably) verifiable in the past, and the link might provide another user with greater resources or expertise with enough information to find the reference. It could also return from the dead. With a dead link, it is possible to determine if it has been cited elsewhere, or to contact the person originally responsible for the source. For example, one could contact the Yale Computer Science department if <span class="link">http://www.cs.yale.edu/~EliYale/Defense-in-Depth-PhD-thesis.pdf</span> [dead link] were dead.
