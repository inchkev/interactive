      The ever-living source of evil on Third Earth in the 1985 animated television series Thundercats is a villain named Mumm-Ra. His powers included sorcery and an unlimited lifespan, and he continually sought to increase his power and spreadhis dark influence (fig. 2).

      The internet is a global system of interconnected computer networksthat rely on the Internet protocol suite—specific communication protocols—to link devices worldwide. Or is it some kind of sorcery? Do Mumm-Ra and the internet have more in common than one might think?
    </p>
    <p>
      Quantum Computer Services was founded the same year that Lion-O, the hero of the Thundercats, used the Sword of Omens (a magical weapon that could fire bolts of energy and give its owner “Sight Beyond Sight,” or the power to see across vast distances). In 1989, Quantum changed its name to America Online (AOL). The company intended to become the service for people unfamiliar with computers. Soon the internet age dawned-and AOL carpet-bombed the masses with 3.5-inch floppy discs and CD-ROMs that proclaimed “Try America Online FREE!”
    </p>
    <p>
     The strategy was successful. When AOL went public in 1992, they had less than 200,000 subscribers (fig. 3). A decade later their subscriber number had ballooned into the 25 million range. Mumm-Ra would have been pleased with that expansion of power.

   The original AOL logo referenced the all-seeing eye (also known as the Eye of Providence), housed in a pyramid form. The symbol represents the eye (fig. 4) of God watching over humanity. Mumm-Ra lived in a black pyramid amid the ruins of an ancient Egyptian civilization. But the fortress, where he retired to replenish his power, ultimately becomes a prison in various episodes of the show. In much the same way, the CD-ROMs and floppies that once heralded the power of AOL became the branded detritus of an ambitious internet pioneer. It seems that all universes eventualy confine unchecked power and ambition.
